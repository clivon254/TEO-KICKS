### E‑Commerce General Flow (Non‑Technical Overview)

This document explains, in simple terms, how the shopping experience works for customers and how the management experience works for admins and staff.

## Customer Flow

- **Guest access**: Browse the store, view collections and products, and read details. To add items to cart, wishlist, or compare, you must log in.

- **Register and login**: Create an account with your phone/email or sign in with Google, Apple ID, or Instagram. You can also continue as a guest and register later during checkout. Forgot Password and Reset Password are supported.

- **Verify OTP and activate account**: When you register, you receive a one‑time code (OTP) by SMS or email. Enter it to activate your account and unlock all features.

- **Profile and settings**: Update your personal details, change password, manage notification preferences, and save addresses for faster checkout.

- **Receive alerts and notifications**: Get updates for order status, promotions, price drops, low stock, and important account messages (in‑app, email, or SMS).

- **Set and manage addresses**: Add multiple addresses (home, office, others). Choose a default to speed up checkout.

- **Search and discover products**: Use search to quickly find items. Explore by collections (e.g., New Arrivals), categories (clothes, shoes, caps & hats, glasses), brands, and more.

- **Filter and sort**: Narrow results by category, collection, size, color, style, price, rating, availability, and other variants/options. Sort by relevance, newest, price, or popularity.

- **Wishlist**: Save products you like, organize them, and remove them anytime. Items can later be moved to cart.

- **Compare products**: Compare key details (price, features, materials, sizes, colors) between selected products to decide faster.

- **Product details and customization**: On the product page, choose variants (e.g., size, color) and customization options if available (e.g., print/logo/text). See real‑time price and stock per variant.

- **Stock & pre‑orders**: Product availability updates in real time. If a variant is out of stock, it cannot be added to cart unless pre‑ordering is enabled. You can opt‑in for notifications to be alerted when an item is back in stock.

- **Packaging options**: Choose a preferred packaging option (e.g., standard, gift, premium) with clear fees before checkout.

- **Contact the shop**: Send a message to the store with your email and message content from the Contact page. You’ll receive a confirmation and a response via email, in‑app notification, or SMS.

- **Reviews (verified purchase only)**: Write reviews and ratings only if you purchased and received the product (Delivered). Reviews are marked with a Verified Purchase badge.

- **Cart and quantity management**: Add items to cart, adjust quantities, change selected variants, or remove items. The cart shows item totals, shipping estimates, and any savings.

- **Apply coupons**: Enter valid coupon codes from the store to get discounts or special offers. See savings before paying.

- **Checkout**: Securely confirm address, delivery method, and payment. Review order summary and apply coupons. You can still edit cart items here.

- **Fulfilment & scheduling**: Choose fulfilment “now” or schedule for later (a small scheduling fee may apply). You can order while in the shop or away.
  - In the shop: pay immediately or post the order to your bill (settle individual orders or pay all posted bills at once).
  - Away: choose self pick‑up or delivery. Delivery fees are distance‑based (per kilometer) and shown before payment. Away orders must be paid during checkout.

- **Order creation and tracking**: After payment (or choosing Cash), the order is created. You receive confirmations and can track progress from your account: Placed → Confirmed → Packed → Shipped → Out for Delivery → Delivered. If cancelled or returned, you’ll see that too. A receipt is generated; you (customer) receive a copy and the store retains a copy in the order record.

- **Payments**: Choose your preferred method:
  - M‑Pesa (Daraja) prompt on your phone for quick approval
  - Card via Paystack (Visa/Mastercard, etc.)
  - Cash (on delivery or pick‑up, if available)

## Admin & Staff Flow

- **Login and profile**: Staff sign in to a secure admin panel and manage their profile. Access is role‑based so each person only sees what they should. Email/password or SSO (Google, Apple ID, Instagram) are supported. Forgot/Reset Password available.

- **Product management**: Add new products, define their variants (e.g., size, color, material), upload photos, set pricing and discounts. Update or delete products, and view the full catalog.

- **Variant‑level stock**: Track inventory per variant (e.g., Size M / Red) and update stock counts. Low‑stock alerts help prevent stock‑outs.

- **Analyze sales**: View dashboards and reports showing sales, revenue, top products, best customers, and campaign results.

- **Order management**: See all orders and move them through each status step (Placed → Confirmed → Packed → Shipped → Delivered). Handle cancellations, returns, and refunds. View/download receipts and resend them to customers when needed.

- **Inventory & stock rules**: Real‑time stock updates. Configure whether items allow pre‑orders; out‑of‑stock items can’t be added to cart unless pre‑order is enabled.

- **Packaging fees**: Define multiple packaging options per product with different fees.

- **Variants management**: Add, update, delete, and view any variant/attribute (e.g., size, color, zippers, long/short sleeve) and attach them to products.

- **Fulfilment & delivery configuration**: Enable scheduling (with fee), set delivery fee per kilometer, and define rules for in‑shop vs away payments.

- **Rider operations**: Riders (a staff role) can view available delivery orders and claim them for fulfilment.

- **Bulk product ops**: Upload products individually or in bulk; bulk delete when needed.

- **Reviews moderation**: Review center to approve/reject reviews, remove inappropriate content, and manage review settings (only verified purchasers may review; one review per user per product; optional review window after delivery).

- **Role‑based access**: Create roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, Staff) and set permissions so only authorized people can perform sensitive actions.

- **Coupons and promotions**: Create and manage coupon codes and special offers (percent/amount off, bundles, free shipping, limited‑time deals).

- **Store details and hours**: Configure shop contact email/phone, physical location, timezone, business hours (per day), and days off/holidays. This information is shown to customers and used for availability messaging.

- **Broadcast messaging**: Send announcements and updates via in‑app notifications, email, or SMS (e.g., new collection, campaign launch, holiday sale).

- **Customer reach‑outs (Inbox)**: View all contact messages from customers, assign owners, set statuses (open/resolved), and reply via email, SMS, or in‑app messages. Conversation history is kept per customer.

- **Customer and staff management**: View customer profiles and order history, assist with issues, and manage staff accounts and roles.

- **Campaigns and offers**: Plan campaigns, set audiences, schedule start/end times, and monitor performance.

- **Create orders on behalf of customers**: From the admin panel, create an order and prompt the customer to pay (e.g., send an M‑Pesa prompt or Paystack link), or mark as Cash when appropriate.

This flow gives a clear picture of what customers experience and how admins keep the store running smoothly.
