### E‑Commerce General Flow (Non‑Technical Overview)

This document explains, in simple terms, how the shopping experience works for customers and how the management experience works for admins and staff.

---

## Customer Flow

- **Guest access**: Browse the store, view collections and products, read details, compare items, and add to wishlist or cart. Some actions (checkout, saving wishlist) ask you to create an account or log in.

- **Register and login**: Create an account with your phone/email or sign in with Google, Apple ID, or Instagram. You can also continue as a guest and register later during checkout. Forgot Password and Reset Password are supported.

- **Verify OTP and activate account**: When you register, you receive a one‑time code (OTP) by SMS or email. Enter it to activate your account and unlock all features.

- **Profile and settings**: Update your personal details, change password, manage notification preferences, and save addresses for faster checkout.

- **Receive alerts and notifications**: Get updates for order status, promotions, price drops, low stock, and important account messages (in‑app, email, or SMS).

- **Set and manage addresses**: Add multiple addresses (home, office, others). Choose a default to speed up checkout.

- **Search and discover products**: Use search to quickly find items. Explore by collections (e.g., New Arrivals), categories (clothes, shoes, caps & hats, glasses), brands, and more.

- **Filter and sort**: Narrow results by category, collection, size, color, style, price, rating, availability, and other variants/options. Sort by relevance, newest, price, or popularity.

- **Wishlist**: Save products you like, organize them, and remove them anytime. Items can later be moved to cart.

- **Compare products**: Compare key details (price, features, materials, sizes, colors) between selected products to decide faster.

- **Product details and customization**: On the product page, choose variants (e.g., size, color) and customization options if available (e.g., print/logo/text). See real‑time price and stock per variant.

- **Cart and quantity management**: Add items to cart, adjust quantities, change selected variants, or remove items. The cart shows item totals, shipping estimates, and any savings.

- **Apply coupons**: Enter valid coupon codes from the store to get discounts or special offers. See savings before paying.

- **Checkout**: Securely confirm address, delivery method, and payment. Review order summary and apply coupons. You can still edit cart items here.

- **Order creation and tracking**: After payment (or choosing Cash), the order is created. You receive confirmations and can track progress from your account: Placed → Confirmed → Packed → Shipped → Out for Delivery → Delivered. If cancelled or returned, you’ll see that too. A receipt is generated; you (customer) receive a copy and the store retains a copy in the order record.

- **Payments**: Choose your preferred method:
  - M‑Pesa (Daraja) prompt on your phone for quick approval
  - Card via Paystack (Visa/Mastercard, etc.)
  - Cash (on delivery or pick‑up, if available)

## Admin & Staff Flow

- **Login and profile**: Staff sign in to a secure admin panel and manage their profile. Access is role‑based so each person only sees what they should. Email/password or SSO (Google, Apple ID, Instagram) are supported. Forgot/Reset Password available.

- **Product management**: Add new products, define their variants (e.g., size, color, material), upload photos, set pricing and discounts. Update or delete products, and view the full catalog.

- **Variant‑level stock**: Track inventory per variant (e.g., Size M / Red) and update stock counts. Low‑stock alerts help prevent stock‑outs.

- **Analyze sales**: View dashboards and reports showing sales, revenue, top products, best customers, and campaign results.

- **Order management**: See all orders and move them through each status step (Placed → Confirmed → Packed → Shipped → Delivered). Handle cancellations, returns, and refunds. View/download receipts and resend them to customers when needed.

- **Role‑based access**: Create roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, Staff) and set permissions so only authorized people can perform sensitive actions.

- **Coupons and promotions**: Create and manage coupon codes and special offers (percent/amount off, bundles, free shipping, limited‑time deals).

- **Store details and hours**: Configure shop contact email/phone, physical location, timezone, business hours (per day), and days off/holidays. This information is shown to customers and used for availability messaging.

- **Broadcast messaging**: Send announcements and updates via in‑app notifications, email, or SMS (e.g., new collection, campaign launch, holiday sale).

- **Customer and staff management**: View customer profiles and order history, assist with issues, and manage staff accounts and roles.

- **Campaigns and offers**: Plan campaigns, set audiences, schedule start/end times, and monitor performance.

- **Create orders on behalf of customers**: From the admin panel, create an order and prompt the customer to pay (e.g., send an M‑Pesa prompt or Paystack link), or mark as Cash when appropriate.

This flow gives a clear picture of what customers experience and how admins keep the store running smoothly.
